## My name is Stu Peters and I am a Co-Founder and Director of Business Development at ChainSafe Systems.


I am passionate about the blockchain technology:
* because it’s all built using the open source ethos;
* because there are no barriers to entry
* and because everything is handled as transparently as possible.

In this workshop I will guide you through the basics of blockchain and I hope I will manage to inspire you to join the quest for a more decentralized world!

I am trained in Web Development and a Blockchain enthusiast since 2013 so if you have any questions or comments, please ping me on the chat (@stupeters187).

Hope you will enjoy the ride.
