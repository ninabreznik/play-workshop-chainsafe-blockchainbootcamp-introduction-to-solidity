## Solidity types

Solidity is a statically typed language, which means that the type of each variable (state and local) needs to be specified. Solidity provides several elementary types which can be combined to form complex types.

In addition, types can interact with each other in expressions containing operators.

The concept of “undefined” or “null” values does not exist in Solidity, but newly declared variables always have a default value dependent on its type.
