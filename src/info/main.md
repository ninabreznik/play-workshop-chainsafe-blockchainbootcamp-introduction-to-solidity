## Introduction to Solidity workshop

In this workshop we will:
- get to know how similar and different Solidity is compared to other languages,
- analyse the structure of the contracts,
- dive deeper into: state variables, functions, function modifiers, events, structs, data types etc.
- check out some contract examples  

If you have any questions, feel free to join the chat where myself, other mentors or learners will be happy to help you out!
